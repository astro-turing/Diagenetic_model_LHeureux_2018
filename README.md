# L'Heureux Legacy Fortran code
This is the original Fortran code that was used to produce the results in L'Heureux 2018 paper "Diagenetic Self-Organization and Stochastic Resonance in a Model of Limestone-Marl Sequences".

## Building and running
Run `make` to build the code with `gfortran`. The executable should appear in the `./build` directory. Running it will produce several output files in plain text format.

## License
There is currently no license on this code. We are working to fix this issue.
